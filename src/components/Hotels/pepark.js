    pepark Hotels is one of the most luxurious & prominent hotels in Mumbai. It is located at 
      a very prime location in Manali. The hotel is just 3 km away from Mall Road, therefore; it will 
      barely take 5 minutes by vehicle to reach. The accommodations are very comfortable and cosy. 
      In addition,
       we highly value our guests’ privacy that’s why we have designed the hotel rooms accordingly. 
       You can glance
        at beautiful views from the room to enjoy the beauty of Mumbai. Moreover, there is enough space 
        in the balconies
         and lawn that you can enjoy your evenings, nights or entire day with your special ones. We also have an amazing 
         dining room where we serve mouth-watering dishes 
      of different cuisines. At pepark, we intend to make each of our guest’s stay the best.</div></div>
